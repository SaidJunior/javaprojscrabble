WELCOME TO SCRABBLE
===================

For some background on the game please visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble


THE BEGINNING
=============
Once you start the application you enter 'n' for starting
a new game, or if you want to load an existing game enter 'l'.
To get some help press 'h', and to exit press 'q'.

SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Once you have created a new game, you have to choose the rules set:
1) Basic ('b'):
   Each cell is worth exactly one point, and the program decides 
   by herself what is the longest word that was created.
2) Advanced ('a'):
   Each cell has a random weight (1-4) and the user has to decide
   which word he wants to be counted.

Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4), and the 
names of the players (length less then 50).
