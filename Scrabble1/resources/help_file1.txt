For some background on the game please visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble


THE BEGINNING
=============
Once you start the application you can choose between a new 
game or to load an existing game.

SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4) and the rules set:
1) Basic: Each cell is worth exactly one point, and the program decides 
   by herself what is the longest word that was created.
2) Advanced: Each cell has a random weight (1-4) and the user can place only one letter.

Now enter the names of the players (length less then 50) and choose if anyone of them should be automatic. FIRST ENTER THE NAME, AND THEN PRESS THE CHECK BOX.
Notice that the first player must be human.
Notice that an auto player is only possible at the basic rule set.
