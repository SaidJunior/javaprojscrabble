PLAYING THE GAME
================
Ok, what you see now is a 15X15 table with a random word in the middle. Your job is to select letters from your letter set in the bottom and place it on the board to create a meaningful word.
You can select the button "change letter" to throw one of your letters and get a letter from the main letter set. How you do that? after pressing the button you just press the letter you want to change and the letter would immediately change. After you do that, there is no way back!You can change up to 3 letters.
You can select the button "place word" for adding a letters to the board. A letter is placed by first click on the letter and then click on the right place on the board. After you placed a letter there is no way back!!! Your placed letter must be a valid word according to the game's dictionary. It must be placed up-down or left-right. Your placed word must, also, use one of the currently placed letters on the board. It is ALLOWED to attach two different words(for example dogcat) 
	
Anyway when you want to pass the turn to the next player, press "Done".
If the next player is automatic, and you want it to play, press "Done" and his action will take place immediately.

Now it all depends which game rule you selected: 
If you are in the basic mode the program decides herself which word to take, and if you are in the advanced mode, you will be asked to enter the start and end coordinates of the word.

Now it's time for your opponent to play...

The game ends once the main letter set is empty. Then the winner will be determined.
