THE BEGINNING
=============
Once you start the application you can choose between a new 
game or to load an existing game.

SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4) and the rules set:
1) Basic: Each cell is worth exactly one point, and the program decides 
   by herself what is the longest word that was created.
2) Advanced: Each cell has a random weight (1-4) and the user can place only one letter.

Now enter the names of the players (length less then 50).
