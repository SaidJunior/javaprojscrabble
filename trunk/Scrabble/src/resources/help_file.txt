SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Once you have created a new game, you have to choose the rules set:
1) Basic ('b'):
   Each cell is worth exactly one point. If you created more than one VALID	word, 
   you will automatically get points for the longest one. You can place as many letter that you 
   currently have.
2) Advanced ('a'):
   Each cell has a random weight (1-4). You can place only ONE letter at each turn. 
   When you want to announce a word you should enter the exact start and end coordinations.

Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4), and the 
names of the players (length less then 50).

new letter. Entering the letters must be in a LEFT TO RIGHT/ UP TO DOWN order. 
If you entered an invalid values such as not empty board cells it will not approve, 
and you would lose your turn. Notice that you MUST use in your placed word at least one
