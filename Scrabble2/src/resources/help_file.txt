WELCOME TO SCRABBLE
===================

For some background on the game please visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble

THE BEGINNING
=============
Once you start the application you enter 'n' for starting
a new game, or if you want to load an existing game enter 'l'.
To get some help press 'h', and to exit press 'q'.

SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Once you have created a new game, you have to choose the rules set:
1) Basic ('b'):
   Each cell is worth exactly one point, and the program decides 
   by herself what is the longest word that was created.
2) Advanced ('a'):
   Each cell has a random weight (1-4) and the user has to decide
   which word he wants to be counted.

Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4), and the 
names of the players (length less then 50).

PLAYING THE GAME
================
Ok, what you see now is basically 15X15 table with a random 
word in the middle. Your job is to selct letters from your 
letter set in the bottom and place it on the board to creare 
a meaningful word.
You can select 't' to substitute one of your letters with 
a letter from the main letter set.
You can select 'w' for adding a letter to the board. 
's' is for saving the game, and 'q' is for exit.

Once you select 't' you will be asked to enter the index of the
letter you want to swap. 
Once you select 'w' it will ask you for the coordinates of the
new letter. If you enter invalid values such as a place that
has no neighboring letters or a table cell, it will not approve.

Now it all depends which game rule you selected: 
If you are in the basic mode the program decides herself which
word to takem abd if you are in the advanced mode, you will be 
asked to enter the start and end coordinates of the word.

Now it's time for your opponent to play...

The game ends once everyone letter sets are empty and the 
main letter set is also empty. Then the winner will be determined.
