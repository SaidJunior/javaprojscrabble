WELCOME TO SCRABBLE

For some background on the game please visit

THE BEGINNING
=============
Once you start the application you can choose between a new 
game or to load an existing game.

SETTING THE PREFERENCES
=======================
Now you have to choose the number of players (1-4) and the rules set:
1) Basic: Each cell is worth exactly one point, and the program decides 
   by herself what is the longest word that was created.
2) Advanced: Each cell has a random weight (1-4) and the user can place 
only one letter.

Now enter the names of the players (length less then 20) and choose if 
anyone of them should be automatic. Notice that the first player must be human.
Notice that an auto player is only possible at the basic rule set.
=======================

PLAYING THE GAME
================
Ok, what you see now is a 15X15 table with a random word in the middle. 
Your job is to select letters from your letter set in the bottom and place 
it on the board to create a meaningful word.

You are ready to place words. A letter is placed by dragging it to the 
right place on the board. A valid cell would be marked when hovering over it.
After you placed a letter there is no way back!!! 
Your placed letter must be a valid word according to the game's dictionary. 
It must be placed up-down or left-right. Your placed word must, also, use 
one of the currently placed letters on the board. It is ALLOWED to attach 
two different words(for example dogcat)

You can also select the button "change letter" to throw one of your letters and
get a letter from the main letter set. How you do that? after pressing the 
button you just press the letter you want to change and the letter would 
immediately change. After you do that, there is no way back!You can change 
up to 3 letters.

 	
Anyway when you want to pass the turn to the next player, press "Done".
If the next player is automatic, and you want it to play, press "Done" 
and his action will take place immediately.

Now it's time for your opponent to play...

The game ends once the main letter set is empty. 
Then the winner will be determined.
